The project was primarily focused on file handling (in this case, working with CSV files).
The objective was to create a program that, based on a predefined filter, would display a list of customer data for a telecommunications service provider.
As a bonus, our team added another CSV file representing the operators of the telecommunications service. These operators were randomly assigned to each customer who did not yet have an assigned operator.
